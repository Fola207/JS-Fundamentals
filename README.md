# JS-Fundamentals

## Introduction
This repository contains fundamental JavaScript projects designed to help understand the basics of JavaScript programming. These tasks cover scripting in JavaScript using Node.js and essential concepts such as variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and more.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Understand why JavaScript programming is powerful.
- Run JavaScript scripts using Node.js.
- Create variables and constants in JavaScript.
- Differentiate between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Explore JavaScript data types and operators.
- Use conditionals (`if`, `if ... else`).
- Implement loops (`while`, `for`) and control flow.
- Utilize break and continue statements.
- Define and use functions effectively.
- Work with objects, arrays, and intrinsic JavaScript objects.
- Understand function scopes and return values.
- Manipulate dictionaries and import files.

## Project Structure
Each task is implemented as a standalone JavaScript script. Below is the list of tasks:

### Mandatory Tasks:
1. **0-javascript_is_amazing.js** - Prints `"JavaScript is amazing"`.
2. **1-multi_languages.js** - Prints multiple language-related statements.
3. **2-arguments.js** - Prints messages based on the number of arguments passed.
4. **3-value_argument.js** - Prints the first argument passed.
5. **4-concat.js** - Prints two arguments in `" is "` format.
6. **5-to_integer.js** - Converts argument to an integer and prints it.
7. **6-multi_languages_loop.js** - Prints language-related statements using a loop.
8. **7-multi_c.js** - Prints `"C is fun"` multiple times based on input.
9. **8-square.js** - Prints a square using `X` characters based on input size.
10. **9-add.js** - Prints the addition of two numbers.

## Usage
To run a JavaScript script:
```sh
node <script-name>.js
